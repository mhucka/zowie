Icon sources for Zowie
======================

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/term/tag-exclamation-point/326951/) of an exclamation point circled by a zigzag, used as the icon for this repository, was created by  [Alfredo @ IconsAlfredo.com](https://thenounproject.com/AlfredoCreates/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

I edited the logo in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS to change the icon color to the orange used by Caltech in their logo.

I created the files [zowie-icon.icns](zowie-icon.icns) and [zowie-icon.ico](zowie-icon.ico) using the macOS desktop application [iConvert Icons](https://iconverticons.com).
