Icon sources for Zuppa
==========================

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=soup&i=3124151) of a bowl of soup, used as the icon for this repository, was created by  [ghufronagustian](https://thenounproject.com/ghufronagustian/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

I edited the logo in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS to change the icon color to the orange used by Caltech in their logo.
